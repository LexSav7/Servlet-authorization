Servlet authorization form (security). Implemented with Filter interface. 	
	
	
Login and registration functions should be implemented in separate servlets. In my case, there are all in my Filter, which is not right. It happened this way due to the simplicity of the app (just one authorization form and one home page). Will correct this soon, just don't have enough time (and who uses servlets anyway :)
